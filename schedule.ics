DESCRIPTION:Increasing awareness of personal data stored on centralised ser
 vers and individual need to access personal data in a connected world is d
 riving the development of frameworks to support data sovereignty and priva
 cy. The Australian National University’s Software Innovation Institute i
 s collaborating with Gurriny Yealamucka Health Service (Gurriny) in the Ya
 rrabah Indigenous community of North Queensland\, Australia\, to build pri
 vacy focused data infrastructure and associated software applications call
 ed the Solid Health System which will provide individuals with storage\, o
 wnership\, and control over their own health data.  This model is using So
 cial Linked Data (Solid) technology\, a decentralised data storage specifi
 cation for software application development\, using open standards mostly 
 developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Open source Solid server
  provides users with a secure online storage space called a personal onlin
 e datastore (POD) to store their own data with granular control of data sh
 aring using data access control policies to provision a trust-no-one envir
 onment. Cross-platform software applications are being developed with the 
 Dart and Flutter framework to interact with PODS on a data pipeline built 
 with Python.

DESCRIPTION:Collaborative learning in the classroom has been shown to have 
 a broad range of positive academic effects such as promotion of critical t
 hinking\, communication skills and improved learning outcomes. It also bri
 ngs social and psychological benefits such as development of friendships\,
  social support\, reduced anxiety and increased appreciation for the cours
 e content.\n\nUnlike a traditional classroom\, programming education tends
  to offer few opportunities for group activities as students tend to be re
 stricted to their personal laptops  or to allocated workstations and are e
 xpected to learn in relative isolation. This is often due to environmental
  factors\, such as it being hard to share a keyboard between more than two
  students at a time. Additionally\, educators often design solo activities
 \, because they are easy to implement and execute in the classroom. Since 
 programming students aren’t trained to code with other people\, they do 
 not develop clear ideas on what good collaborations look like or how to co
 llaborate with others successfully\, which is an important skill in the wo
 rkforce.\n\nPair programming is an oft cited solution\, yet sharing workst
 ations can be unsatisfying as one student is left in the backseat while th
 e other drives. The situation is worsened for larger group sizes. Furtherm
 ore\, there is no ability for a group of students to divide and conquer a 
 problem as their attention and input must be the same as the driver.\n\nTh
 is talk will introduce approaches to collaborative programming that extend
  beyond pair programming by allowing more than two students to collaborate
  in real-time on projects ranging from single Python scripts\, to multi-fi
 le projects and Jupyter Notebooks. This has been accomplished across pairs
 \, small groups\, and even entire classrooms during both live classroom en
 vironments and for long-term group projects. We will also discuss the less
 ons we learnt along the way\, as well as feedback from other educators and
  students.

DESCRIPTION:Programming education increasingly centres around tools that of
 fer automatic marking of student progress through a set of exercises. Auto
 mated marking has become increasingly popular as it allows instructors to 
 provide personalised feedback to students in real-time and is easily scala
 ble to large cohorts. It can also be used to provide instructors with deta
 iled insight into the class progression.\n\nWhile this brings many new adv
 antages it also creates new problems. Chief amongst those is the difficult
 y of marking long\, dynamic and interactive programs which places a large 
 burden on educators to develop sophisticated marking systems.\n\nAt the mo
 re extreme end of the problem\, we may be faced with students who want to 
 take shortcuts such as hard-coding\, or using Python’s built-in function
 ality and third party packages\, which may violate the spirit of the exerc
 ise. As a result these students may not be achieving learning outcomes.\n\
 nIn this talk we will discuss and demonstrate practical approaches to the 
 aforementioned problems that all educators can use to simplify marking and
  to increase their assurance of learning. We will also discuss current lim
 itations that we face and provide recommendations to those wishing to appl
 y these approaches.

DESCRIPTION:This talk will demonstrate an example of building trusted data 
 pipelines with 3D packages: Dagster\, Dbt\, and Duckdb. First\, it present
 s the importance of trusted data pipelines by testing data quality. It the
 n discusses what we need to test data quality\, from high levels (like tab
 les\, relations\, …) to low levels (like rows and columns). After that\,
  I will show how to implement these tests using different Dbt packages lik
 e dbt-utils and dbt-expectations.\n\nFinally\, a demo with a complete ELT 
 workflow will be presented. In this demo\, Dagster is used as a data pipel
 ine orchestrator\, and Dbt is utilized for data transformation with its re
 lated testing packages. These transformed pipelines sit on top of Duckdb\,
  which acts as a small data warehouse. This demo is published in a GitHub 
 repository\, allowing developers to clone and run the demo independently. 
 \n\nThe talk will help data and analytics engineers build more robust test
 s for their data pipelines. These trusted data pipelines could enhance the
  data quality and validation process\, reducing the risk of other data iss
 ues like data drift for downstream channels.

DESCRIPTION:You know it as the fuel gauge in your car\, the blinking lights
  on your modem or the operational status page of your favourite cloud serv
 ice. It's diagnostics! A data efficient technique for seeing how well your
  system is running in real time.\n\nWhat isn't so well known is that diagn
 ostics can be embedded directly into your python application. Doing it thi
 s way provides a purely on-demand and human-readable interface of real-tim
 e system state and performance.\n\nCompared to a sequence of log messages\
 , diagnostics are certainly more difficult to implement. After all\, loggi
 ng is essentially just some well-placed print statements\, outputted to a 
 file or third-party logging agent. \n\nBut this type of logging can be exp
 ensive\, bandwidth intensive and hard to make sense of. Have you ever had 
 to trawl through pages and pages of logs just to check your application is
  working well? \n\nIn this talk\, you will learn a number of practical and
  pythonic techniques for serving custom diagnostics from within your appli
 cation.

DESCRIPTION:The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6\, states acce
 ss to safe drinking water and sanitation for all is a human right. Potable
  and sewer water networks are critical infrastructure to achieve this glob
 ally. In Australia\, the annual industrial expenditure on potable and sewe
 r water services is around 4.5 billion AUD. Managing and maintaining a cal
 m water network is important from a consumer\, environment and government 
 perspective. Over the past few years\, major water utilities across Austra
 lia have exponentially  added data collection through deployment of a wide
  range of IoT devices across the potable and sewer water networks. However
 \, currently\, this data is rarely used to effectively create insights to 
 enable decision support that transforms productivity\, reduces cost and mi
 nimises risk.\n\nAt Spiral Data\, we focus on developing Artificial Intell
 igence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) tools towards creating these insight
 s and decision support across the water industry. In this talk\, we will d
 iscuss two important use cases that were designed\, developed and deployed
  using our python base tech stack through our cloud partner (AWS).\n\n1. I
 dentifying blockages in gravity sewer systems\nBlockages can happen especi
 ally in sewer networks and large blockages can have major environmental im
 pact. However\, detecting blockages is difficult since there are no curren
 t alarms or alerts. In this use case\, we will discuss how we use AI/ML ap
 proaches to identify blockages in networks that can then raise an alert. T
 his in turn can in turn enable support crew to address the blockage in a t
 imely manner. These alerts can also enable operations teams to effectively
  plan around their limited budget and human capacity.\n\n2. Identifying hi
 gh speed pressure changes in potable water network to monitor pipe failure
 s\nPotable water networks\, especially in large metro areas can experience
  recurrent large pressure changes (transients). This can be due to users (
 ex: fire testing) or it can be network induced (ex: valves/pump operation)
 . These pressure transients can cause unexpected failures and as a result 
 monitoring them is of pressing importance. However these data are collecte
 d at very high rates and as a result it cannot be analyzed at scale by hum
 ans. At SpiralData\, we are building automated solutions using AI/ML to id
 entify\, analyze and group these high speed pressure transients. This in t
 urn becomes a valuable tool to pursue field investigations to identify sou
 rce and to also plan better for capex expenses.

DESCRIPTION:With all the hype about applications that uses machine learning
 \, I think there is one key aspect that developers tend to forget: **"Perf
 ormance check and monitoring"**.\n\nML and AI services have become very ac
 cessible and can be integrated into any application you can think of. But 
 what do you do after you integrated your ML models to your application? <u
 >How do you know that the output of the ML models are correct and up to st
 andard? What are the signs that the model's performance is changing and ho
 w do you take action on such changes? </u>\n\nTypically\, these problems a
 re just discussed on a theoretical and research level. But how can we carr
 y over these techniques and apply it to our application? Not just that\, h
 ow can we make it so that monitoring and performance check is as simple as
  writing a unit test (or not).\n\nIn this session\, we will learn some sim
 ple but effective ways on model performance monitoring as well as look at 
 some python implementation and architecture consideration.

  2025.\n\nThis is a huge engineering and organizational undertaking\, and 
 Python is supporting us all the way.\n\nThis talk shall start with an over
 view of the energy grid as it has been pretty much for a century. We shall
  look at the physics of electricity and the control systems required to ma
 intain constant\, reliable supply.\n\nManagement of the grid involving the
  movement of large volumes of data from sensors in the field\, to centrali
 zed data stores. Data is merged with models and used to make operational d
 ecision in near real time\, to design the grid into the future\, and to an
 alyse faults in the past.\n\nPython is used to support these data flows an
 d models and executes in a high availability environment on servers\, as w
 ell as on users’ desktops supporting ad hoc analysis.\n\nWith every line
  of new code\, Python becomes more critical to Australia’s energy future
 .\n\nWe shall cover three broad topics:\n\na) A little power system engine
 ering: How the grid works.\nb) Case study: Modeling the grid in Python wit
 h code fragments.\nb) Case study: The weather (sunny? windy? hot? cold?) a

DESCRIPTION:Experimenting\, building a model\, and putting it into producti
 on takes a long time. The time difference might range from months to years
 . The distribution of data may vary throughout this time gap\, resulting i
 n differences between the data used to train and create the model and the 
 data that the model encounters in the production environment. \n\n\nThe pe
 rformance of models degrades over time as a result of this drift\, resulti
 ng in weak and declining predictive performance in predictive models. This
  is a typical occurrence\, but it is a significant problem in performance-
 critical Machine Learning systems. \n\n\nToday's data is changing and evol
 ving at a breakneck speed. It's critical to keep up with shifting data if 
 you require high-performance models. As a result\, it's critical to spot t
 he point in production where your data diverges from the one it was traine
 d on.\n\n\nLearn how these drifts affect our machine learning models and h

 geocoder: an algorithm that converts a text input into a standardized outp

  this can be costly and slow when there are a large number of locations. F
 urthermore\, in sensitive domains such as healthcare\, the use of an exter

DESCRIPTION:In addition to its role as the scripting language of choice in 
 the 3D graphics world\, Blender one of the leading 3D art programs is buil
 t with Python and is packed full of ways you can use Python code to create
  3D content both directly and through plugins that sometimes even have the
 ir own Python APIs. Come with me on a short journey into how you can creat
 e 3D content using Blender\, its plugins\, and Python!

DESCRIPTION:Everyone wants to understand why things happen\, and what would
  happen if you did things differently. You’ve probably read that statist
 ics can only tell you if things are correlated\, or associated\, and this 
 explains nothing about cause and effect. But in fact there’s a process c
 alled Causal Inference which does answer these questions\, can tell you if
  A causes B and more importantly\, can tell you what would happen\, if… 
 This talk will help you to frame and tackle these questions using your dat
 a and some popular Python libraries.

DESCRIPTION:Python is a programming language known for its usefulness and e
 ase of readability\, making it an excellent choice for quickly creating se
 rvices. These services can be scaled to millions of users. However\, a myr
 iad of problems comes hidden with it during the development phase if obser
 vability-driven development is not followed like the inability to meet the
  SLAs\, poor performance\, difficulty in tracking business metrics\, etc a
 nd this can lead to anti-patterns in software.\n\nMetrics such as these ca
 n be valuable for root cause analysis\, driving business goals\, component
 -level monitoring\, improving performance\, and so on. In this presentatio
 n\, I will discuss how to adhere to best practices for observability and r
 eliability when building a Python service from the ground up. I will expla
 in the meaning of each concept\, how to establish a culture that promotes 
 these practices and provide a detailed code walkthrough demonstrating how 
 to implement these concepts effectively.

DESCRIPTION:Drawing (or rendering) has long been one of the surprising and 
 amazing things computers can do. But what about sketching\, are computers 
 any good at it? Differentiable Rendering is a technique borrowed from the 
 field of machine learning that does exactly that! In this talk we will cov
 er how it works and demo what it can do.

DESCRIPTION:Python with its flexible typing is amazingly productive - in a 
 short time you can come up\nwith an awesome program.  But as that program 
 ages and grows its like a child with \nuntied shoe laces. Which is where t
 ype hints come in - type hints are easy to use\, will \nhelp tie up laces 
 and continually check that they don't come undone again.
